This repository contains all the code used in the CSET report "Will AI Make Cyber Swords or Shields" and the companion paper available on arXiv.

We hope that interested parties will be able to download and run the code, adapt it to suit their intuition about the range of inputs to the models, and build on (or critique) the models to advance debate about the future of cybersecurity.
